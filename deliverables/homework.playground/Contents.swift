//: Shopping List - Week 2
//: This week we'll be building out the data model pieces of our shopping list app

import Foundation

//: Create a ListItem struct that will store the items for our shopping list. Include attributes for name and optional description

//: Create a ItemCategory enum for categories that our items could belong to. Include 'grocery', 'household', 'clothing' and anything else that you think might be good.

//: Create a ShoppingList class that will store our shopping list items, associated with the categories you created above. Include a quantity for each item type as well.

//: Add a method to your ShoppingList class to add an item, with it's associated category and a quantity

//: Add a method to your ShoppingList class that will return a sorted list of your items, sorted by name alphabetically.

//: Add a CustomStringConvertible extension to your ShoppingList class that will print your items, with their quantities, with one item per line, sorted by name alphabetically. Include the header "Shopping List:" and prefix each item with "  - ".

//: Create a method on ShoppingList that returns a new array containing the first letter of each item, in uppercase. The returned array should be sorted and not have any repeated characters.

//: Create a method that searches the items array and returns all items that match the input string. Ignore uppercase/lowercase differences.

//: Uncomment the code below and make sure your code above works properly

// let milk = ListItem(name: "milk", description: "cow juice")
// let bread = ListItem(name: "bread")
// let broom = ListItem(name: "broom")

// var list = ShoppingList()
// list.addItem(bread, .Grocery, 3)
// list.addItem(milk, .Grocery, 2)
// list.addItem(broom, .Household, 1)

// print(list)

// let firstLetters = list.itemFirstLetters()
// let matchingItems = list.itemsMatching("m")
